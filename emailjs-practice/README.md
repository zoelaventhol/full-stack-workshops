# EmailJS Practice

This repository guides step-by-step how to set up [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) within a React application.

All of this information is sourced from - and can be found in - the [EmailJS Docs](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/).

## Project Setup
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to compile and run locally in your browser

## Step 1: EmailJS Config
1. Create an account at [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/).
2. "Create a new service" - basically, connect an email account with EmailJS. You will be prompted to authorize certain permissions to EmailJS from your own email account.
3. "Create a new template."
